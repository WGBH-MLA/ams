He describes some of the rewards of working in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge: ""It is a great place to go record birds and animals. You know generally that once you point your microphone at a nesting bird or a bird that's hopping through the tundra, it's going to be pristine. You haven't got a leaf-blower or an ATV or a plane flying over the top of you ... It's just a beautiful place.""",,,,,,,,,,,stewartm-02,Hard Drive,BirdNote,Master,Sound,"BirdNote Archive, Kessler Productions, Shoreline WA",00:01:45

Back then, the term ""jay"" was slang for a hick, a country bumpkin. Bostonians with little tolerance for rural folk coined the term ""jaywalker"" to describe someone green to the ways of the city and modern traffic signals, someone impudent - or imprudent - enough to step in front of traffic. This impudent Blue Jay looks as if it might do whatever it wants.",,,,,,,,,,,jaywalk-01c,Hard Drive,BirdNote,Master,Sound,"BirdNote Archive, Kessler Productions, Shoreline WA",00:01:45
